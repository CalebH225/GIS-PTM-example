# GIS-PTM-example
A step by step walkthrough on building basic disease maps for Precision Turfgrass Management (PTM)

This was developed as part of a larger presentation "Precision Turfgrass Management: Targeted Applications Edition" at GCSSA Conference and Trade Show 2022.
While this specific project focuses on the disease mapping the concepts are fundemental and can be transfered to other aspects of PTM including irrigation, weed control.

Please Participate in our [survey on irrigation](Tinyurl.com/UMNIrrigationSurvey) it should take between 15-20 minutes to complete:<br>

Data Collected by Wendell Hutchens (Wendelljh@vt.edu) focusing on Baycreek Resort golf course  in Cape Charles, VA as part of a research project for his PhD research.

Required downloads:

Qgis: https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html
This is an opensource GIS software that is free to download
Please be sure to download the appropriate version for your operating system
I would reccomend the stable version to avoid bugs and other issues that may be present in beta versions

Provided Data which inlcudes a boundary shapefile (Example boundary.zip), a point shapefile (Example points.zip) for disease incidence, as well as a geopackage inlcuding the image of of the fairway itself (Example image.gpkg). I appologize for the reduction in image quality that this provides but it is to save space in this repository.
