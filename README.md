A step by step walkthrough on building basic disease maps for Precision Turfgrass Management (PTM)

This was developed as part of a larger presentation "Precision Turfgrass Management: Targeted Applications Edition" at GCSSA Conference and Trade Show 2022.
While this specific project focuses on the disease mapping the concepts are fundemental and can be transfered to other aspects of PTM including irrigation, weed control.
